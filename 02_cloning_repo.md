To develop the model, users need to make a clone of the repo on their local machine. To do this:

1.	The user needs to log onto GitHub and navigate to the repo. To get the repo URL, click on the green “Code” button, and copy to clipboard.
2.	On their local machine, use file explorer to navigate to the folder where you want the model to live (e.g. Veda_models). There is no need to create a subfolder for the model as one will be created by the clone.
3.	Right click, and select “Git Bash here”
4.	At the command prompt type
	
	```git clone <repo_url>```

   The repo URL can be pasted with Shift-Ins, or rightclick-paste
   If you are going to work on the repo immediately, you now need to change directory into the repo folder on Git Bash using

```cd <repo_name>```
